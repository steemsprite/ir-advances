\subsection{Web Page Viewing Behavior}


\begin{frame}{Eye-Tracking}

Ocular behavior:
\begin{itemize}
	\item fixations – relatively motionless gaze which lasts about 200-300 ms
	\item saccades – continuous and rapid movement of eye gazes between fixations (information processing is suppressed during a saccade) \newline
\end{itemize}

Eye-Tracking metrics:
\begin{itemize}
	\item mean fixation duration
	\item gazing time
	\item saccade rate \newline
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Eye-Tracking (2)}

Eye movement behavior:
\begin{itemize}
	\item influenced by individual differences of subjects (the gender) \newline
		- MFD longer for males than females
	\item driven by the order of web pages being viewed and by the interaction between site types and the order of the web pages being viewed
	\item visual complexity contributes to eye movement behavior
\end{itemize}
